abstract: 'We propose Flow Mismatching, an unsupervised anomaly detection method that avoids reconstruction. A flow matching model is trained only on normal images; for a test image, its learned velocity field is compared with the direct geometric velocity toward that image along paths from noise. Mismatches between the two highlight anomalies, and aggregating them across time steps and paths yields pixel-wise heatmaps and image-level scores. We also give a theoretical decomposition of the mismatch, and report results on MVTec-AD and VisA that outperform reconstruction-based and other flow matching-based methods.'
summary: 'Unsupervised anomaly detection from the mismatch between a flow matching model''s learned velocity and the direct velocity toward a test image, giving pixel-wise heatmaps and image-level scores.'

## Overview {#overview}

**Flow Mismatching** is an **unsupervised anomaly detection** method that does not rely on reconstruction. A **flow matching** model is trained only on normal images. For a test image, we compare the model's learned velocity field with the direct geometric velocity toward that image along paths from noise. Where the two disagree, the image is anomalous; aggregating these **velocity mismatches** across time steps and paths gives pixel-wise anomaly heatmaps and image-level scores.

We also provide a theoretical decomposition of the mismatch, and report results on MVTec-AD and VisA that outperform reconstruction-based and other flow matching-based methods.

Accepted to **NeurIPS 2026**.

## Toy-Example Demonstrations {#toy-examples}

A live interactive demo illustrates the velocity-mismatch
mechanism on 2D toy data — a flow-matching model trained only on normal data,
run toward a real data point and an off-manifold point from the same starting
noise draws. Solid arrows show the model's predicted velocity; dashed lines
show the true heading. On the normal target they track each other; on the
off-manifold target they visibly diverge, and that growing disagreement is
the anomaly signal.


**Try it yourself** — play/pause, scrub through time, and switch between a 3-cluster
mixture and a half-moon manifold with a genuinely near-manifold
anomaly (a harder, more subtle detection case than an off-manifold gap point):
